                <p>The field of web advertising is rapidly evolving, driven by emerging technologies and innovative
                    approaches that aim to enhance user privacy, AI-driven technologies and more personalised
                    experiences. The exploration of new trends and technologies is crucial in the dynamic landscape,
                    especially with the recent privacy-focused initiative in digital advertising and immersive
                    technologies. In this blended workshop on <em>Emerging Trends in Web Advertising</em>, the Web
                    Standards Group at Samsung Research and Development Institute UK (SRUK) invites experts from
                    advertising, privacy, data science, and related disciplines to showcase their research and insights
                    on the latest advancements in the field. The workshop will explore key areas such as data privacy in
                    advertising, AI-driven analytics, and the role of immersive technologies in ad delivery. This event
                    serves as a collaborative platform to exchange experiences, discuss challenges, and explore
                    opportunities in leveraging these technologies to redefine web advertising. Participants will have
                    the opportunity to present their work, engage in scholarly discourse, and collaborate on shaping the
                    future trajectory of this interdisciplinary field.
                <p>The workshop is structured into two parts: the <strong>Research session</strong> and the
                    <strong>Brainstorming session</strong>, designed to facilitate both scholarly exchange and
                    collaborative exploration of emerging technologies in web advertising.
                <h2 id=research-session>Research session</h2>
                <p>The Research session will follow a classic presentation-style format, featuring invited talks and
                    paper presentations. The provisional agenda for this session is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Welcome/opening by the organisers: A brief introduction to the workshop, its objectives, and the
                        agenda.
                    <li>Invited talk on AI and Advertising: A presentation by an academic expert focusing on Agentic AI
                        and machine learning in the context of private advertising, exploring their role in enhancing
                        user privacy while maintaining effective advertising strategies.
                    <li>Paper presentations: Presentations of accepted research papers, followed by Q&A sessions to
                        encourage discussion and feedback.
                </ul>
                <h2 id=brainstorming-session>Brainstorming session</h2>
                <p>The Brainstorming session will focus on practical insights and collaborative problem-solving. This
                    session in divided in two brainstorming sessions:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Emerging advertising platform:</em> A 90-minute discussion beginning with a mini
                        presentation on the WebXR Device API, followed by an open discussion exploring challenges,
                        implementation technologies, and the role of sensors, haptic feedback, and vision recognition in
                        immersive advertising. The discussion will also address market trends and future predictions.
                    <li><em>Post-cookie advertising:</em> A 90-minute discussion beginning with a mini presentation on
                        privacy initiatives in the web ecosystem, followed by an open discussion on the impact of
                        private advertising initiatives and other efforts to enhance post-cookie era across the
                        advertising ecosystem.
                </ul>
                <p>This blended approach ensures a balanced combination of academic rigour and practical innovation,
                    providing participants with opportunities to share knowledge, engage in meaningful discussions, and
                    collaborate on shaping the future of web advertising.
